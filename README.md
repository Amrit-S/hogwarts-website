# Set-up

Git clone directory, cd into directory, and then run `npm install` followed by `npm start`. Website should now be run on port 3000 locally. 

Project is focused on improving your front-end skills, so I'm having you implement the code for about 3 pages on the website. Specifically, `Classes.js`, `Gallery.js`, and `Founders.js` which can be found under src/pages. I've commented a "recommended" list of features I'd want for every page at the top of their respective files, but its really up to you if you want to go more complicated/more simple.

I've already implemented `HomePage.js` as a straightforward reference in case you need guidance on how to structure code, break up a page into components, CSS example on making a page responsive, etc. For simplicity purposes, I've made the "client" of the website be Hogwarts so try to focus page content around Harry Potter series though you can reformat the client as you'd like.

Only directory you need to worry about is `src`. Its broken into pages, components, css, and media, so compartmentalize your project accordingly. A few of the features will require library usage so leverage node modules accordingly.

Lastly, the project isn't strictly required for you to do, but I recommend it if you don't have a lot of experience with React/you're a bit rusty on web development/want more practice. Let me know if you have questions.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
